# ATS Guidelines for Resume Formatting

## Overview

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are software applications that help employers manage and screen job applications. To ensure maximum compatibility and parsing accuracy, resumes must follow specific formatting guidelines.

## Critical ATS Requirements

### 1. File Format Compatibility

- **PDF**: Preferred format for final submission (text-based, not image-based)
- **DOCX**: Widely compatible with most ATS systems
- **HTML**: Good for web-based applications
- **Avoid**: Images, tables, graphics, text boxes, headers/footers

### 2. Font and Typography

- **Preferred Fonts**: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Calibri
- **Font Size**: 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for headers
- **Formatting**: Bold and italic are acceptable, avoid underlines
- **Colors**: Black text on white background only

### 3. Section Headers

Use standard, recognizable section headers:

- **Contact Information** / **Contact**
- **Professional Summary** / **Summary** / **Objective**
- **Professional Experience** / **Work Experience** / **Experience**
- **Education**
- **Skills** / **Technical Skills**
- **Certifications**
- **Projects** (if relevant)

### 4. Date Formatting

Use consistent date formats throughout:

- **Preferred**: "Month YYYY - Month YYYY" (e.g., "January 2020 - March 2023")
- **Acceptable**: "MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY" (e.g., "01/2020 - 03/2023")
- **Current Position**: Use "Present" or "Current"

### 5. Contact Information

Place at the top of the resume:

- Full name (largest font)
- Phone number
- Email address
- LinkedIn profile URL
- City, State (full address not necessary)

### 6. Bullet Points and Lists

- Use standard bullet points (â€¢, -, \*)
- Start each bullet with an action verb
- Keep bullets to 1-2 lines when possible
- Use parallel structure

### 7. Keywords and Skills

- Include relevant keywords from job descriptions
- Use industry-standard terminology
- List technical skills clearly
- Include both acronyms and full terms (e.g., "AI/Artificial Intelligence")

## ATS Parsing Best Practices

### Text Formatting

- Left-align all text
- Use standard paragraph spacing
- Avoid text boxes or special formatting
- No watermarks or background images

### File Structure

- Use a logical top-to-bottom flow
- Place most important information first
- Ensure text is selectable (not embedded in images)

### Content Organization

- Keep related information grouped together
- Use white space effectively
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout

## Common ATS Parsing Issues

### Avoid These Elements

- **Tables**: May scramble text order
- **Multiple Columns**: Can confuse parsing algorithms
- **Graphics and Images**: Cannot be read by ATS
- **Headers and Footers**: Often ignored or misplaced
- **Text Boxes**: Content may be skipped
- **Special Characters**: May cause encoding issues

### Problematic Formatting

- Fancy fonts or decorative elements
- Colored text or backgrounds
- Vertical text or rotated elements
- Overlapping text or elements
- Non-standard file formats

## Keyword Optimization

### Research Keywords

- Study job descriptions for relevant terms
- Use industry-specific terminology
- Include both hard and soft skills
- Match the language used by employers

### Keyword Placement

- Include keywords naturally in context
- Use keywords in multiple sections
- Don't keyword stuff or repeat excessively
- Prioritize the most important keywords

## Testing ATS Compatibility

### Manual Tests

- Copy and paste resume text into plain text editor
- Check if all information is preserved and readable
- Ensure proper text flow and formatting

### Online ATS Scanners

- Use online tools to test ATS compatibility
- Check keyword match percentages
- Identify parsing issues before submitting

## Mobile and Screen Reader Compatibility

### Accessibility

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Include alt text for any essential images
- Ensure high contrast ratios
- Use semantic HTML structure

### Mobile Optimization

- Ensure text is readable on small screens
- Use responsive design principles
- Test on various devices and screen sizes

## File Naming Conventions

### Resume File Names

- Use descriptive, professional names
- Include your name in the filename
- Avoid spaces (use underscores or hyphens)
- Example: "John_Smith_Software_Engineer_Resume.pdf"

## Version Control

### Document Management

- Keep multiple versions for different job types
- Maintain a master version with all information
- Customize for specific applications
- Track application submissions

## Summary

Following these ATS guidelines ensures maximum compatibility across different systems and increases the likelihood of your resume being properly parsed and ranked by applicant tracking systems. Remember that while ATS optimization is important, the resume must still be readable and compelling to human recruiters.
