The main goal is to restore and enhance the current testing setup to ensure comprehensive coverage and accurate reporting.

---

## Objectives

### 1. Fix Existing Test Issues
- Address and resolve any problems with the current test suite.

### 2. Enable Full Coverage Testing
- Configure the tests to run from the root directory, similar to the setup before the performance test was added.
- Ensure that all parts of the application are tested, providing full coverage.

### 3. Improve Coverage Reporting
- Use the **Cove** report to:
  - Identify missing HTML coverage.
  - Ensure the "HTML Fail" metric is under 90%.
  - Verify the source coverage.

### 4. Achieve 90% or Higher Coverage
- Confirm that the entire application has at least 90% test coverage.
- If coverage is below 90%, identify gaps and improve tests accordingly.
