# Issue 23: CLI Interface Development

## Overview
The goal is to create a command-line interface (CLI) for the project, focusing on file conversion functionalities. This will involve leveraging the `click` library for ease of use and better help documentation.

## Tasks and Requirements

### 1. Use of `click` Library
- Prefer `click` over `argparse` for CLI implementation.
- Ensure detailed help messages are available for each command.

### 2. Commands to Implement
- **Single File Conversion**
- **Batch Processing**

### 3. Format Options
- Support for multiple formats:
  - PDF (priority, default for resumes)
  - HTML
  - Others as needed

### 4. Configuration Options
- Option to specify a configuration file.
- Option to specify configuration directly as JSON.

### 5. Output Options
- Specify output directory.

### 6. Mode Flags
- Verbose mode
- Quiet mode

### 7. Additional Features
- Version information:
  - Should be accessible via a command or flag.
  - Version info must be synchronized with the `pyproject.toml` file.
- Detailed command help (click handles most of this).
- Clear docstrings for each command in the command group.

## Next Steps
- Review **Issue 22** to ensure current progress aligns with the plan.
- Review **Issue 24** related to configuration integration in Geo.
  - Determine if Issue 24 is redundant; consider closing it if so.

## Notes
- Prioritize PDF format due to its importance for resumes.
- Ensure all options and commands are well-documented for user clarity.
