Now that we completed issue 22 let's work on a plan for issue 23. We need to create the CLI interface. I think we did already do some of that in the past. We should use click for this. I do prefer that over arg parse. We need to add commands for a single file conversion, batch processing commands, format selection options for pdf.x and html. We need to prioritize pdf as specified multiple times in other areas. pdf is priority since this is for resumes and that is the default format that people use. We need to have an option to specify the configuration file and another option to specify configuration as json. We need an option for the output directory specification. We need verbose and quiet modes. We need to have detailed help which click will do most of. We just need to make sure we have a good doc string for any of the commands in the group. We need to have version information and we need to make sure the version information is read from key is kept up to date with the pi project.tomel. We need to review issue 22 to make sure that we're doing the right or make sure that we view the last progress and we need to view issue 24 for the integration the configuration in geo. This has more info on it. Actually I think it's the same so we might want to just close 24.
