You can fix what's wrong with the test, but what I really need you to do is make it so we can run with full coverage for everything from the root directory like we were able to before you made the performance test. I need to have the Cove report term missing HTML fail under 90 and source. I need to be able to test that the full app has 90% or higher coverage if not. It's pointless for us to be making tests for you to verify and validate with.
