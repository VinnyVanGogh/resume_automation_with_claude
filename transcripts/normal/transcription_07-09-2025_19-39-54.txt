Next, we need to work on issue number 22, phase 6, configuration and CLI. We're going to implement the main resume converter class that orchestrates all the components for the complete resume conversion. We need to make sure we create the class, everything. Integrate the parser format or in generators. Add batch processing capabilities, support multiple output formats. Add configuration loading, implement error handling and logging. Add progress tracking, support custom themes and styling. That does depend on issue 21, so we can look back at that if you need to. The definition of done is going to be the resume converter handling all conversion workflows. Batch processing works correctly. Error handling is comprehensive. Integration with all components is seamless and our UV run pie test is passing at 94 to 95%. Preferably 95, but currently we're at 94, so I'll accept that.
