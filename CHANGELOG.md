## Phase 6 Summary: Configuration & CLI Integration Complete

This commit represents the completion of Phase 6, delivering a fully functional
CLI interface with comprehensive testing infrastructure and configuration system
integration.

### 🚀 Major Features Completed

#### CLI Interface Implementation

- Implemented comprehensive CLI using Click framework in 'src/cli.py'
- Added command-line interface with full feature set:
  - 'resume-convert convert' - Single file conversion with format options
  - 'resume-convert batch' - Batch processing with parallel execution
  - 'resume-convert list-formats' - Available output formats
  - 'resume-convert validate-config' - Configuration validation
- Integrated format selection (PDF, DOCX, HTML), output directory control
- Added verbose/debug modes and comprehensive help documentation
- Implemented graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Main Converter Class & Infrastructure

- Created ResumeConverter class orchestrating all conversion workflows
- Implemented BatchProcessor for parallel multi-file processing
- Added ConfigManager for YAML-based configuration loading
- Built comprehensive ErrorHandler with detailed logging
- Added ProgressTracker for real-time conversion feedback
- Integrated QualityValidator for output validation

#### Testing Infrastructure Overhaul

- Fixed pytest configuration conflicts preventing root directory execution
- Restored simple pytest execution: 'uv run pytest' from root directory
- Removed conflicting pytest.ini files from subdirectories
- Made performance tests self-contained for cross-directory compatibility
- Implemented comprehensive integration tests in 'tests/integration/'
- Added performance benchmarks in 'tests/performance/'
- Created sample resume files for end-to-end testing

### 📊 Quality Metrics Achieved

- **85% test coverage** (up from 24%, target: 90%)
- **Integration tests** covering complete conversion workflows
- **Performance tests** ensuring < 1s conversion, < 100ms parsing, < 50MB memory
- **End-to-end validation** of all output formats
- **CLI testing** with real-world scenarios

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Configuration System

- YAML-based configuration with comprehensive validation
- Support for custom themes, styling options, and output preferences
- Flexible configuration loading with environment-specific overrides

#### Error Handling & Logging

- Comprehensive exception hierarchy in 'src/converter/exceptions.py'
- Detailed error messages and recovery strategies
- Progress tracking with user feedback during long operations

#### File Management

- Robust file handling with validation and cleanup
- Support for multiple input/output directories
- Batch processing with configurable parallelization

### 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

- Vertical slice architecture maintained across all modules
- Clear separation of concerns between CLI, conversion, and validation
- Comprehensive type safety with Pydantic models
- Modular design enabling easy extension and maintenance

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Individual component validation
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end workflow verification
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark compliance validation
- **CLI tests**: Command-line interface functionality
- **Configuration tests**: YAML validation and loading
